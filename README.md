                       all encryp2cloud backups as it is stored globaly for git and not localy

"         A                                B                            C              "
" .--------------------.       .----------------------.        .----------------------."
" |directory to backup |  -->  | google_drive (local) |  --->  | google_drive (cloud) |"
" | pictures etc..     |       | .git db stored here  |        | .git database        |"
" | readable files     |  -->  | encrypted files here |  --->  | files encrypted      |"    
" | .git link here     |       |                      |Â        |                      |"
" .--------------------.       .----------------------.        .----------------------."
 
  If you place 'A' (directory to be backed up) at OTHER physical disc than 'B' (Google Drive sync folder) location
  you will have two levels of backups.
